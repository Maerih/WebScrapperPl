Web scraping, web harvesting, and web data extraction refer to the automated process of gathering and extracting data from websites using specialized software. The process involves sending HTTP requests to web servers and parsing the resulting HTML or other structured data to extract the relevant information.

Web scraping software typically uses sophisticated algorithms to navigate website structures and locate data elements such as text, images, and links. The software may employ techniques such as regular expressions, XPath expressions, or CSS selectors to locate and extract data.
